# EDSS Calculator

The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the most common clinical scoring system used to evaluate the condition of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. The overall disability score ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments

 The scale has been developed by John F. Kurtzke. The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these.

## Getting Started

This project is an open source implemenation of the EDSS Calculator in Javascript. While developing a registry for patients suffering from Multiple Sclerosis, in Montenegro. A need arose for implementing an EDSS Calculator to help the physicians to make a better EDSS assessment when entering data related to patient visit.
